# Ender-3-MKS-SGEN-L-V1-Marlin-Firmware
Marlin 2* Firmware for Sgen L V1 opt for Ender-3. Custom Screens to add that more Offical look.
Custom Configs to drop straight in to marlin or to use as a template.
Any help plaese leave in the issues page and I'll see where I can help.
The Hardware I have based the firmware around is-
  Mks SGEN L V1 
  TMC2208 Stepper Drivers Uart 
  Standered Ender-3 Frame 
  Standered Steppers to the Ender-3 
  Reprap smart discount graphical screen copy (or a replacement screen with EXP 1 and EXP2 ports on the back)
The Hardware may not be perfect for others but suits me to my needs.
Any changes to the Hardware above will need to be reflected in the config files.
Background of the project.
I only preduced this file as I wanted to get back into 3D printing again after so meny years,
I found a broken Ender-3 and used some parts I had for my Tevo Trantular Pro but never got to use. No one really had a firmware for the SGen L V1 board, just talks about someone new someone who had working firmware but no ware to obtain said frimware, hence this. Is it perfect? No but does work well enough to share with you.
I have "build" Marlin firmware befor and understand enough to get something working correctly, hence me knowingly this is not perfect polshed product.
