Ender-3 ABL Marlin 2.1.0.1 Firmware with active Auto Bed Leveling and stepper driver cooling on HE1 port.
This Firmware is to run on the MKS SGEN L V1 with TMC2208 Uart drivers with BL touch or CR touch.
It uses Custom boot screen as well as a custom status screen close to the orignal crealtiy screen.
Advantages of an Auto Bed Level is to allow the system to find the end of z axis as well as maping any warping of the bed.
The Bed should always be flat to the nozzle and should be regulary checked and rest the probe z offset in the printers settings.
When using any Auto Bed Level Firmware do not forget to add G29 below G28 on the your slicer printer settings to enable Auto Bed Level when printing.
I'm not looking in to updating the Firmware as it does well with several weeks of printing on it and had no issues.
If you wish to change any values to suit your build, I have included the config files to drop in to Marlin.

To disable stepper driver cooling just go to config adv and comment define USE_CONTROLLER_FAN.
